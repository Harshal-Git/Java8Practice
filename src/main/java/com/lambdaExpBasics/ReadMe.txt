This is to show how lambda can be prepared using anonymous classes.

Functional interface behavior w.r.t inheritance:

1. Functional interface can have only one abstract method. But it can have multiple default OR static methods.

2. "@FunctionalInteface" annotation is not mandatory. But it's recommended to use it.

3. Interface method override rules are maintained in functional interface inheritance. So in such case, child cannot provide a new interface method 
		(except static / default) if parent has already an public abstract method. Though it can override parent interface method.
