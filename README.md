java 8 practice 

-> Practice programs for Java 8 

-> Based on some practice - best way to write lambda expression for any functional interface I found as

	1. Separate problem statement in different parts and identify what all methods are needed for stream operation.
	 
	2. Based on methods' arguments decide what anonymous functional implementations are needed and write those.
	
	2. First use functions in methods, and if it founds successful; copy implementations in lambda manner and delete/hide the 
			anonymous function code.

Project specifications:

-> main() methods to execute the code are provided in "*Client.java / Demo*.java" class.

-> Maven: Maven structure built with version-3.6.3

-> Java: Project configured for Java 8. Expected java version (8 and above) can be updated in pom.xml file.
